# rinterpreter (WIP)

This project is a Rust implementation of the Lox programming language interpreter, based on the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html) by Robert Nystrom.

## About Lox

Lox is a dynamically-typed scripting language designed for learning purposes. It features:

- Basic data types (numbers, strings, booleans, nil)
- Variables and arithmetic
- Control flow (if statements, while and for loops)
- Functions and closures
- Classes and inheritance

## Project Goals

The main objectives of this project are:

1. To gain a deep understanding of interpreter design and implementation
2. To practice and improve Rust programming skills
